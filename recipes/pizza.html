    <h2>Mamma mia!</h2>
    <p>
      What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of
      course! Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we
      exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a
      brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for
      Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza. I told him if he helped me make it I
      would talk about him on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to
      get his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" but he loved
      picking his own toppings, and the finished product was "awesome".

    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105째F-115째F)</li>
      <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a
        wood-fired pizza oven)
      </li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
        Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes
        until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't
        dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom,
        indicating that the yeast is still active and alive. (Note that if you
        are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is
        required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle
        attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing
        paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to
        medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. If you don't have
        a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.
        The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too
        wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place
        the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated
        with the oil. At this point you can choose how long you want the dough
        to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will
        result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2
        hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work
        with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the
        dough in a warm place (75째F to 85째F) for 1 1/2 hours. For a medium rise,
        place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen
        counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in
        the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours). The longer the
        rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.
