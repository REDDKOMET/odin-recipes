    <h2>A great summer recipe</h2>
    <p>
      These burgers offer a rich and meaty taste, with a punch of zesty herbs
      that can be customized with your preferred flavors. A few simple key
      ingredients help to consistently create juicy hamburger patties, no matter
      which cooking method you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while you’ll love the terrific savoriness of these homemade hamburgers
      on their own, they are excellent for loading with your favorite toppings
      to create truly one helluva great burger. This is sure to be your go-to
      recipe for easy burger patties from scratch!

    <ul>
      <li>Ground chuck</li>
      <li>Crushed crackers</li>
      <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper,</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First, add an egg to a large bowl and whisk. We want to whisk the egg
        first because we want to handle the mixture as little as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add ground chuck, panko, shallot, garlic, Worcestershire, oregano,
        smoked paprika, ground cumin, salt and pepper. Using clean hands, mix
        just until combined. Don’t overmix or you’ll have tough burgers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate: the colder the patties, the better they will stick
        together, so it is a good idea to refrigerate your patties for at least
        15 minutes before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip Once: as the burger goes from cold to warm, to cooked, it is more
        likely to fall apart, so handle your burger as little as possible on the
        stovetop or grill. You should only need to flip your burger once. This
        will also ensure even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once your burgers are done to your liking, you are welcome to add cheese
        directly to the hamburger patties, or you can make my toasted cheddar
        buns.
